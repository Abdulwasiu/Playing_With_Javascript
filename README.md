# Playing_With_Javascript
Play ground for Javascript
Hey, Abdulwasiu here. I like javascript php and css. I want to play around with them and probably build something of my self...
<?php>
echo 'Hello, world';
define ('cut',"<br/>");
echo cut;
echo "I am trying to discipline my self to make things without just talking about them!";

//I have just written some php codes and and tried to introduced my self. I hope I am able to do this everyday....

<?>
